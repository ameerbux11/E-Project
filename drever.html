              <td>Overview</td>
              <td id="dog_overview" style="text-align: justify;">As a working dog, the Drever's long body and short legs—inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke—are its most distinctive traits, although they are not overdone.  Its fur is short and can be any colour with white markings, albeit not all of them are white, as this has been connected to deafness.  The breed has a long tail and the characteristic drop (hanging) ears of a hound.  A Drever's withers can reach a maximum height of 38 cm (15 in), which is roughly 15 cm (approximately 6 in) shorter than a long-legged hunting hound of the same size.  Compared to the Drever, the Westphalian Dachsbracke is around 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter.The Drever is characterized by his constant, slight tail wag and is alert, composed, amiable, and even.  Long after its human companion has satiated his own hunting impulse, the Drever frequently wants to keep working.  It is a strong tracker with an excellent nose.  It is sluggish than other hounds due to its short legs.  It is therefore perfect for guiding prey toward the hunter's firearm.  Although the Drever is a dependable worker who occasionally hunts deer, hare, and fox, this dog has the guts to take on a wild boar.  In these situations, he avoids the prey by circling it and barking loudly to alert the hunter.The Drever's melodic voice and superb nose seem to be considerably more impressive than his size would suggest.  Because the Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt, it is crucial that his owners treat him with the same level of sternness to convey to him his position among his human pack.  The finest in this breed will be brought out by owners who are resolute, consistent with the regulations, and exhibit a natural authority over the dog that is stern but not harsh.  Dogs with passive owners will grow obstinate and independent.  Those that are under-led and/or under-exercised will acquire peculiarities in their disposition.  Make sure to properly socialize this dog.</td>

              <td id="dog_history" style="text-align: justify;">Small sized German hounds were imported to Sweden in 1910. These dogs gained a reputation as very good deer trackers. In 1947, the larger variety of these dogs was given the name Drever, and it was soon recognized as a Swedish breed. They are considered the first choice breed for deer tracking but are also used for hunting hare and fox. The Drever was recognized by the United Kennel Club January 1, 1996.</td>
